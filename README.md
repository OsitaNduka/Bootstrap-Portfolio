# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Week 3 Challenge - Bootstrap Portfolio
## Description
This is my professional profile created using Bootstrap. My professional profile page contains past and present jobs
and skills I learned as a bootcamp student. I used my professional profile to showcase my work as a web developer.
My Bootstrap professional profile contains what I have learned such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and GitHub, and
Bootstrap. I learned to use hyper text mark-up language (HTML), cascading stlye sheet (CSS), and JavaScript to 
create a website. 

I also learned to use Git a version control on my local machine to keep track of the progress of my work, to create 
folders and files, make changes, delete files, commit or save files and finally push it up to Github repository. 
The Github repository as the name implies is where you deposit or save your code, deployed and hosted online.
The Github pages is used to deploy the code to the internet, world wide web (www), using a unique address known as 
Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

I learned to use Fluid design or responsive design to make sure website scale with the size of the screen, this way
no matter the size of your screen, the html tag will shrink or expand accordingly and not break the page and to use
@media breakpoints in Css for different screen size, so that no matter what device (mobile, Desktop or Laptop), it on
the web page will display perfectly.

I also learned to use Bootstrap to create a complicated website. As a bootcamp student I have learned the Front-end 
foundations which covers the fundamental concept of web development such as front-end technologies command-line fundamentals,
user experience design APIs, Git and Github, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Third-party APIs(jQuery,Bootstrap), Server-side APIs,
AJAX, JSON and Agile software development methodologies.


## Usage
My professional profile contains my work as bootcamp student such my prework study guide, profile website, CSS snippet cheatsheet 
and Horiseon site. I created these sites to showcase what I have learned. I expect to learn more skills such as Front-end frameworks. 
It includes Node.js, Test-driven development, Object-oriented programming (OOP), REACT, Behaviour-driven development deployment and How
to create a professional project portfolio.
